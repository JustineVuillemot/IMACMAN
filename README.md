# IMACMAN

## What is it ?

This project is a C++ / OpenGL 3D pacman game.

## Why do this project ?

It was a project realised during an OpenGL course at IMAC engineering school in Paris.

## How to test it ?

### With a Linux environment

The project was coded with the CLion compiler on Windows so the project wasn't created with a `Makefile` thus I recommend you to use a compiler.

### With a windows environment

Like I said in the previous section, the project was coded on CLion. If you have the compiler installed on your computer I would recommend you to open the project with it.

## How to play ?

The project opens on a 3D world where pacman is a simple sphere. You can move your character using the Z-Q-S-D keys (French keyboard equivalent to W-A-S-D). You can move the camera buy right clicking and moving while still on the button. You can zoom in and out with the mouse wheel. You can pause the game by hitting Esc (escape). It provides you with a menu where you can save, load and restart the game. To exit the menu press Esc (escape) again.
